## *Today's Lesson*

# Working with APIs

Today we will learn how to work with various RESTful APIs, and how to build our own.

## Agenda

### Introduction                                    .agenda-time[(15 min)]
### Building a Book and Drink Recommender with Ruby .agenda-time[(55 min)]
### Integrating our Recommender into Rails          .agenda-time[(remaining time)]

# Topics Covered

- What is an API?
- Why APIs?
- API tools (Postman, curl)
- Endpoints
- Using a simple API
- Using an authenticated API
- Environment management
- Building an API
- Caching API Results

---


# Goals:

To learn how to:

a) Work with APIs within a web application

b) Build our own API

---


# What is an API?

<b>A</b>pplication
<b>P</b>rogramming
<b>I</b>nterface

--

A way for software to interact with a system programmatically

--

API is a broad, general term, and can range from interacting with:

- a ruby `String` class (i.e. with the methods `length` and `reverse`)

--

- the Rails framework (this is why the Rails documentation is at http://API.rubyonrails.org/)

--

- a website with an application we've built<br>(which is what we'll be focusing on today)

---


# Why APIs?

--

Make it easy to interact with a website (as opposed to *web scraping*)

--

Most applications built today use a variety of APIs, and you're encouraged to use them for your final project.

--

Often the best final projects combine a few APIs in a new and novel way.

---


# Why APIs?

Most major entities on the Internet offer an API to consume their data and services.

## Reasons:

- redirect traffic back to their sites (e.g. Facebook, Twitter)
- enrich their service (e.g. Spotify)
- sell data
- share data ([Open Data Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/))

---


# What are some APIs?

- https://lcboapi.com/

- https://developer.nytimes.com/

---


# How to consume APIs

- Postman
- curl
- Web Browser (JavaScript)
- Ruby gems
  - general (e.g. Net::Http, HTTParty)
  - API specific (e.g. twitter gem)

---


# Endpoint

*A unique URL that represents an object or collection of objects*

## Examples:

https://lcboapi.com/docs

https://developer.nytimes.com/books_api.json

---


# Complexity

Range from:

- easy to use (no key required, simple `get` requests)

- key required

- implementing OAuth and callbacks (so you can you interact with a service on behalf of a user)

- OAuth combined with continual key refreshing

---


# Postman

https://www.getpostman.com/

- try: lcboapi.com/products

---


# Curl

```shell
> curl lcboapi.com/products
```

---


# HTTParty

- install

- try: lcboapi.com/products

---


# Book and Drink Recommender

- what we'll be building today

- start with ruby, then move it into a rails application

- demo ruby and rails app

---


# NYT Book Lists

--

- get NYT API key

--

- make request for all lists

--

- display lists

--

- have user select single list

---


# NYT Books on a List


--

- make request for books on a list

--

- display books

--

- have user select a book

---


# NYT Book

- make request for single book

---


# Drink

- split book summary into words and sort by longest to shortest

--

- make a product search request to LCBO API for each word until one is found

--

- display recommendation

---


# Prep for Rails

- move logic into a class

--

- remove input / output functionality (as this will be handled through a web interface)

--

- move key to environment variable

--

  - very important, especially working with APIs that involve you putting your credit card in

--

  - don't check unencrypted keys into a git repo - bots crawl github looking for keys (for example, the spin up servers for spamming or cryptocurrency mining)

---


# Rails App

- start a new rails app

- move ruby class we created into rails

- create a `recommender` controller

---


# Book Lists

- route
- controller action
- view

---


# Books based on List

- route
- controller action
- view

---


# Drink Recommendation

- route
- controller action
- view

---


# Caching results

- with class variable:

  - lists

--

- with database:

  - books on list
  - book
  - drink

---


# Turning our App into an API

```ruby
respond_to do |format|
  format.html
  format.json { render json: recommendation_hash }
  format.xml  { render xml:  recommendation_hash }
end
```

Test with Curl or Postman:

```shell
curl --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     localhost:3000/recommender/recommendation?isbn=0062238469
```

or

```shell
curl --request GET \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --data 'isbn=0062238469' \
     localhost:3000/recommender/recommendation
```
