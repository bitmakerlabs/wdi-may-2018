Advantages of OOP

1) Encapsulation

  - Allows to CLASSIFY concepts


2) Information Hiding

  - State is PRIVATE
  - Behaviour is used to access State

3) Abstraction

  - Internals of an object is irrelevant
  - You just have to know how it works



Classification

  - definition: Assign something to a particular class

*Class*: "House"

*Instance*: "16 Elm St", "22 Oak St"



@ ---> "Instance Variable"


Type of Object |   State                |  Behaviour
