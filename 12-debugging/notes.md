## Good habits for avoiding bugs
- spelling and typing properly
- use atom's shortcuts/autocomplete
- pseudocode and planning properly
- running the code frequently as you go
- reading your code
- close things as soon as you  open them (if/end, each/end, def/end, <p></p>, brackets {})
- pair programming (two heads are better than one)
- using meaningful names (variables, methods, classes)
- following conventions/rules of language (capitalization, underscores, etc)

## Debugging Techniques
- read the error message (line number, description)
- read it aaaaaalll the way to the end
especially for `undefined method ___ for Nil:nilclass`
- print things to the terminal
- take a break
- google the error
- google the problem
- ask for help
- comment out parts of the code
- revert to working commit and try again
- turn it off and on again
- use a debugger
