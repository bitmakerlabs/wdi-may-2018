# Problem: Pig Latin
# Pig Latin
 # "apple" => "appleay"
 # "plum" => "umplay"
 # grape => apegray
 # Natalie => atalieNay
 # "squeeze" => "eezesquay"

# if the word starts with a consonant, move the letters up until
#   the first vowel to the end of the word
# - add ay at the end

# method that takes english word as argument
# returns that word in pig latin

# define array of vowels

# loop through each letter
  # look at each letter starting from index 0
  #  if it's a vowel, stop looping
  #  else move that letter to the end
# end of loop

#  just add ay at the end of the word
